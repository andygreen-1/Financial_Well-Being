# Predicting Financial Well-Being: A Machine Learning Approach

## Final Project for Course PPOL 565: Data Science II - Applied Statistical Learning, Spring 2020

This repository contains the code, source data, and written report for an analysis exploring Americans' financial well-being. In this analysis, I use a combination of linear regression and a k-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict individuals' financial well-being, and explore some of the most important factors that help in predicting financial well-being. 

You can find a brief summary of the files available in this repository below:
